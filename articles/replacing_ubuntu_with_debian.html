                Replacing Ubuntu with Debian
            </h2>
            <p>
                My interest in Linux evolved in the year 2013 and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> was the distribution of my choice then, as it has been recommended multiple times to be a good beginner distro.
                I have not been disappointed. Ubuntu is indeed one of the easiest, if not, the easiest Linux distribution for people who are just getting into UNIX.
                However, as time has passed, I grew bored with the Unity desktop environment and using the same tools over and over. I had the feeling that something was missing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew that Ubuntu is based on <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, but was not ready yet to use it. Then, after approximately 1 year, I was finally fed up.
            In this time I have used Lubuntu 13.10 and Ubuntu 11.04 on one computer and mainly Ubuntu 12.04 as well as Ubuntu 14.04 on a laptop.
                About 1 week ago, I decided that I wanted to replace Ubuntu with Debian, after having tested a live CD of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I've downloaded number 1 of the DVD ISO file, which contains the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> desktop environment in the default install.
                Additionally to that, you can install 3 other desktop environments from this image. Precisely, <a href="http://kde.org/">KDE</a>, <a href="http://lxde.org/">LXDE</a> and <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">XFCE</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that I am using Debian for a while, I must say, that having a pure Debian system is quite refreshing.
                Note however, that one important part of the Debian philosophy is depending on using stable and rigorously tested software instead of using the latest software.
                Don't expect Debian to run the latest programs. That's not what it's about.
                Nonetheless, you can of course install the newest software by downloading the source packages and compiling them.
                You can also use the "testing" and "unstable" repositories, instead of using the "stable" ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, I think that Debian as well as Ubuntu are great beginner distributions.
                Ubuntu being the easier one. It depends entirely on you and your experience with computers in general, so choose wisely.
